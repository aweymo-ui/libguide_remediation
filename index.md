At the library, we have been working together to make sure our digital collections and main site meet the technical standards of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and part of those efforts has been to make sure all of our instructional material is formatted correctly so all of our patrons can navigate our materials easily.
